Introduction:
    What is LinuxKit?:
        Toolkit to Build immutable (kernel + filesystem)
    

  LinuxKit components:
    RunC
    ContainerD

  LinuxKit configuration:
    It's just yaml file
    Services
    Init
    Everything is based on docker containers

    input ( YAML Configuration )  ->  [Downloading containers with parts of the filesystem]  ->  output ( filesysytem + kernel + bios )

  LinuxKit default targets:
    RaspperryPi3
    AWS EC2
    Baremetal 
      Arm64
      AMD64

  How to use it:  

    $ linuxkit build linuxkit.yml
    $ linuxkt run linuxkit.yml

  From where take configuration:

  What if your hardware is not supported?:
    - Add support to your device
    - mostly it's just bunch of Dockerfile configurations
    - and little bit go code

  What if you don't want to add new hardware?:  
   - It's still pretty good thing to learn about Docker, Linux and Security
   - Scripts to extract mainstream kernels
   - It could be useful as developer tool 
   - Or part of the current development cicle
